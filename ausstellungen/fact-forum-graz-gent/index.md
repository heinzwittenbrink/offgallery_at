**ECoC-AXIS: Graz - Rijeka - Novi Sad** is a three-year interdisciplinary project in urban space that fosters cooperation and dialog between creative practitioners (students/professionals in the field of architecture and photography, and beyond) and local micro-communities, including vulnerable groups (migrants, refugees).


Through creative workshops, exhibitions, site-specific art and architecture installations, and a documentary, network/blog and publication the ECoC-AXIS is designed to encourage the low-threshold participation, as well as to provoke a change of perspective on the living space. It thus supports a more comprehensive, inclusive and tolerant view on the people we share this space with.
Participating in the CREATIVE PRODUCTION in photography, writing and architectural performance, participants can realize: If I can produce something that is being seen, then I am seen, too.
As an effect, the project fosters positive influence on the process of establishing tolerance and diversity in urban space. The activities of the project are designed to educate and promote the value of a humanistic common ground.


In 2019, the project **ECoC-AXIS** was marked by SPACE REFLECTIONS: a series of experimental workshops on photography in architecture and urban space, held in **Ljubljana** (May 2019) and **Novi Sad** (July 2019). The results of these workshops are now presented in **Graz** (November 2019), followed by a further creative investigation in Graz-Gries.
