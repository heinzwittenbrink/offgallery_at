<h1>Eva Holts: My Reflection about the War in Ukraine</h1>

<h2>Über das Projekt</h2>

</section>


<section id="running_text">


  <p>In all the artworks you see not only detached Barbie parts, but some foodstuffs too. Food could be murderous, dangerous, desired – always a cornerstone, which helps to raise awareness of a lot of war related problems. It is not limited only by a physical sense of fullness, it covers a much broader field of meanings, one of which is an important message, worth to live and die for, and something that is possible both to keep you going and kill.</p>
<h3>Naked and Homeless Help Each Other</h3>
<p>Everybody must have lost something in this war. Some people have fled the country with literally nothing, but a backpack on their shoulders (word for word ‘naked’), some people have lost their houses (and even worse – their loved ones). Still stories, when people pull together and help one another, pluck at my heartstrings. Crackers always reminded me of house walls. Burnt crackers strike me as a burnt house.</p>
<h3>Banana Missiles</h3>
<p>Created immediately after I found out that the house, where I used to live before the war, was attacked by a missile. There were a lot of victims, plenty of flats burnt down, including mine. Heads of barbies are innocently sticking out of the box windows, waiting to be rescued. In the same breath, the house is being hardheartedly attacked with banana-missiles.</p>
<h3>Spaghetti Easter Cake</h3>
<p>I do not normally celebrate Easter because of my complicated relationship with God. However, I saw some people, who had at least the bare possibility to celebrate, buying traditional Easter cakes, painted eggs, and cooking holiday dishes. Other people, to the contrary, especially in the occupied regions with heavy fighting, instead of Easter cakes, ate dry spaghetti, since they had neither any slightest chance nor practical facilities to cook them. In contrast, I decided to add dry spaghetti to my Easter cake. And this combination reminded me of an explosion.</p>
<h3>Russian Cheese</h3>
<p>In Ukraine there is one type of cheese, which is called ‘Russian’. Against my will, I grue each time I bump into it on the counter. But once I decided to buy it, add some limbs to it in order to put this monster on potatoes, as Russia did, when they got on Belarus ground, to fire the missiles.</p>
<h3>A Sandwich</h3>
<p>When Chernihiv was shelled, my mother had to look for water and food. It was one of the most struggling months in her life. The garage of her house was hit, and she nearly died. After the liberation of the Chernihiv region, the traffic to the city was restored. I was finally able to send her some parcels with food. Simple and tasty: cereals, canned goods, cheese and sausage. I thought that it would make her happy, because she would be able to eat her fill and celebrate Easter. But her words just knocked me out: ‘Yep, I do have food. A lot of food. However, I am afraid to eat it.’ This artwork is about the fact that after all the fear of being left without bread and water you have experienced, it is extremely hard to enjoy a sandwich, as it used to be before. It becomes a lump in your throat</p>
<h3>Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori</h3>
<p>From Latin, this sententia means ‘It is sweet and honorable to die for your own country’. Ukrainian soldiers are defending their Motherland, but I would rather you did not take it for granted and think it is as easy as falling off a log. Death is never an easy choice, it is pain (either swift-slowing or longstanding). That is why the Chupa Chups lollipop on the barbie, who is aiming to meet a skeleton – symbol of death – halfway, neck, could be perceived rather ironically.</p>
<h3>In the Grave Clothes</h3>
<p>Barbie in ice-cream represents a human being, who managed to get out of the occupied place. She is in the grave-ice-cream-clothes, surrounded with a lot of overturned derelict cars.</p>
