<h1>About the exhibited works of Mariana Pende</h1>
<h2>Leave me in the Shadow</h2>
<p><strong>Sponge, graphite, latex</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mariana Pende, 2022</strong></p>
<p>For this work, a sponge found off the Croatian coast was covered with a layer of graphite dust and treated with latex. The graphite dust came from the waste of the company T.U.P. Graphite dust was often simply disposed of in the sea.</p>
<h2>2006 T.U.P.</h2>
<p><strong>Video 30', Loop</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mariana Pende, 2006</strong></p>
<p>The video shows the factory building of the T.U.P. company in Dubrovnik from sunrise to sunset. The vido refers to problems related to privatisation and to a change of course of Dubrovnik's local politics, which with T.U.P abandoned the last industrial company operating in Dubrovnik and devoted itself to tourism as the only economic activity. Mariana Pende deals with the demise of Croatian industrialisation and the dismantling of the social position of worker-producers, who were also worker-managers for a long time. She asks the viewer to spend as much time as a news programme takes to reflect on the absurdity of the situation..</p>
<h2>About the company T.U.P.</h2>
<p>The Dubrovnik company T.U.P. produced graphite components for the engineering, electrical and transport industries. It was founded in 1953, and the T.U.P. factory in the Gruž district was one of the largest industrial enterprises in Dubrovnik. After the end of Yugoslavia, it initially continued to operate under the ownership of the employees until it was closed down completely a few years ago. The district of Gruž, which was an industrial centre for a long time, is now economically dependent solely on tourism.</p>
<p>Mariana Pende spent a long time researching the factory and the working conditions of those who worked there and began to work with production waste and with graphite and carbon powder. She has developed sculptures and exhibition projects based on this research.</p>
<h2>Mariana Pende</h2>
<p>Mariana Pende (*1973) studied art in Venice from 2002, mainly sculpture with Andrea Grassi, Roberto Pozzobon and Nicola Cisternino. She graduated in art and contemporary music in 2008. In 2005 she exhibited at the 51st Venice Biennale. Numerous other exhibitions followed, including in Frankfurt am Main, Naples, Split, Rijeka, Dubrovnik and Zagreb. Her last major exhibition was <em>Danče de Luxe</em>, a joint project with Olaf Nicolai, in the summer of 2023 at the Meštrović Pavilion in Zagreb. She lives and works in Zagreb and Dubrovnik.</p>
