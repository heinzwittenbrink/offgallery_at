"Wind of Change" is a naive project about feelings of change and hope. I've come up with collages made of screenshots of the wind map over Ukraine, from the first day of Russia's full-scale invasion. I don't know and cannot even imagine where this wind is blowing, but the changes will be global. Even now I see that these days Ukraine has changed, become much stronger, and Russia is gradually paying for all its crimes. Therefore, I sincerely believe that the wind will bring us victory. I will keep making such screenshots until the end of the war, and every month I will make a new collage.
