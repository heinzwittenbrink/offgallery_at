Since the war started on February 24th Kharkiv governance announced a blackout regime. Blackout was a popular practice during the WW2 and was aimed to hide military and civil objects from an enemy. It feels like blackout is the synonym for war. Dark is inside and outside . Every day I saw less and less light from the window of my home â€“ people were running away from the war. The idea of suddenly being left alone in the city paralysed. Starting from 4th of March I managed to overcome the initial trauma and started to capture those rare lights. The idea gave me hope. Every dark picture during this war is my pray for peace. The project is ongoing.
